# Air-canvas-project
Hello guys ever imagined drawing just in air ? here its my latest machine learning using Python - air canvas project using openCV.
its my Machine Learning Skills: A Cutting-Edge Project!
This repository showcases a project exploring the capabilities of computer vision with machine learning techniques.

Project Goal:

Allow innovative way to draw in air by leveraging advanced Python functionalities with MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries. It excels in  real-time gesture recognition, highly accurate palm detection.
